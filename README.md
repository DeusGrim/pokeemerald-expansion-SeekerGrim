# About this branch
This branch adds 5 new pockets to the bag based on changes to it from later generations and 2 extra gimmick pockets
This Branch was made as an updated and proposed commit for the expansion based on AsparagusEduardo's Bag Pocket Branch :
* Medicine (HP, PP and status recovery items)
* Power-Up (Vitamins and evolution items)
* Battle Items (X items, Pok√©doll/FluffyTail and hold items with battle effects)
* MegaStone (made to alleviate the space needed for all the megastones to fit in one game)
* Z-Crystals (same as the megastone pocket but specifically for Z-Crystals)

The new order for the pockets is the following:
* Items
* Medicine
* Pok√© Balls
* Battle Items
* Berries
* Power-Up
* TMs & HMs
* Mega Stones
* Z-Crystals
* Key Items

However, it reuses the original pocket sprites until I'm able to get new ones for the new pockets.(solved)

* Used DPPT Bags and Changed to match Emerald Bag Colors

To-Do:
* New bag sprites.(finished)
